<h1>Hi! Anshul Singh here. 👋</h1>
<br>

<h3>I work as a Front End Developer! 🖥</h3>

<i>..and it has been around 2 years from the start of my professional journey. 📈</i>

💁‍♂️ I've always been a person that was intersted in solving Mathematical and complex problems 📔 so programming has been a good fit for me. ✅

🎓 I have a Bachelors' degree in Computer Science and Technology. 

🎯 After joining my first and current company, I got to be a part of ReactJS Bootcamp and post completing that I've delivered in multiple projects as a React resource. 

❤ Watching anime aand playing chess are my all time escapes.
